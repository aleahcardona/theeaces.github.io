      <h2>What content does the audience prefer?</h2>
      <article>
        <p>As per the result of our survey last time, majority of the respondents like to watch gaming. We also asked them what particular game would they like to watch on our stream and most of them answered Call of Duty: Mobile. So our team decided to play this game once we start our live streaming.</p>

      <h2>Things Needed for our Stream</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Streaming videos can be done in any platform like Facebook, Youtube, and Twitch. We decided to use Facebook as our streaming platforms because its easy to access and most of the people are familiar with Facebook. We would also need internet connection to air the stream, and lastly, we will need microphones so we will be able to communicate with each other.</p>

      <h2>A Logo that will represent our team</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Since we will be streaming a game that focuses on gun fights, we chose green as our background and we put an overlay there of a gun that intersects with each other and a capital letter A to represent our group name, The Aces.</p>

      <h2>Time Management</h2>
      <article>
        <p>We do consider everyone's availability so we've come up with the conclusion to execute the stream during our Independent Study time or after class. This is to respect everyone's schedule and to make sure that those who want to watch our stream will be able to join us during their free time. </p>

      <article>
        <p>We're planning to create a poster to promote our stream and we would like to post it on different social media platforms. Social media is one of the easiest way to promote something. </p>

          <h3>Characteristics of a Good Streamer</h3>
        </header>
        <p>1.) The Behaviour of the Streamer - This is the first and largest topic since I believe it is the most crucial in determining whether or not I will remain with a stream. I put streamer ahead of material since a consistent streamer is far more dependable than relying on specific stream content. Streamers come to mind as coworkers or classmates. Would I feel comfortable interacting with you if we were in the same area and had to do so frequently? When determining this, I take into account a few criteria.</p>
        <p>2.) Consistency - This is a large one that covers a lot of ground when it comes to streaming. When it comes to consistency, I examine the frequency of streaming, the flow of stream content, as well as mood and conduct. It's tough to keep interested in a stream when the start times are unpredictable, the streamer regularly starts content and walks on before finishing it, or the streamer appears to be a new person each time. I've found that having a game or a specific piece of content act as the backbone for someone's broadcast is the most effective way to maintain consistency. It's conceivable to bounce back and forth between diversity and consistency from there, especially if fresh strides are made.</p>
        <p>3.) Layout and Balance of the Stream - The aesthetics and sound quality of someone's stream are crucial, perhaps even more so for some than for others. When it comes to widescreen 16:9 games, I prefer full-screen games with no extra fluff. If the streamer has a webcam, there's almost always a good small place to tuck it into, and it just makes viewing more comfortable when there aren't any noisy boundaries distracting from the game. Frames and layouts don't deter me from watching a video unless they divert my attention away from the actual content.</p>
