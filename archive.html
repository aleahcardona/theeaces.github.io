      <h2>I. Summary of the Stream</h2>
      <article>
        <p>To encapsulate our stream, we played one of the popular online games, Call Of Duty: Mobile. The goal of our stream is to entertain people, share some knowledge about the game, and make new friends.  Our live stream transpired last February 16, 2022 at 3:00 in the afternoon until 4:00 P.M. The live stream was done through facebook for the reason that most of our viewers often use facebook to watch streams than other streaming platforms. We started with our stream with a waiting video so we will be able to invite and convince our friends and classmates to watch our live. After some time, when we’re already satisfied with the number of viewers, we proceeded with the stream. The first few games consist of only the host playing but we also decided to play with our viewers so in that way, our interaction will bring us closer to each other. The host was able to make new friends with the people who commented on the live stream. Though we had a hard time trying to relive for 3 times because of the stream issues, we enjoyed playing with our viewers and we all had a great time. We were struggling to proceed with the live stream because of the software we are using. </p>

      <h2>II. Things well done during the Stream</h2>
      <article>
        <p> Even though there is some minor problem during our stream we ensure that we all did our best and we also followed the plan we made for our stream. We were able to, first, handle the minor problem without the viewers noticing that the hosts were panicking because of software problems, this is one of our biggest accomplishments because we were able to take an immediate action to the problem for our stream to be smooth and for the viewer to enjoy because we doesn’t want our viewers to be stressed too knowing that we’re having difficulties fixing the lags. Second, the Collaboration between the streamer and the informer. Before the stream was aired, we made sure that one of the members had another device to keep them updated if the stream was having a problem from the perspective of the viewer. This doesn’t only benefit the streamers but also the viewers. Ensuring that the host and the informer have communications, viewers don't need to worry about voicing out their thoughts because the informer will be ready to transmit the message to the hosts. </p>
        <p>  But the biggest achievement we had was we were able to offer our viewers a fun stream they can watch whenever they feel bored and we, the streamers, are also happy because we made new friends and we’re to take the things well done during the stream to strive harder and be better in all aspects. </p>

      <h2>III. Area of Opportunities</h2>
      <article>
        <p> To be honest, our stream wasn’t that perfect and we’re aware that there are things that we need to improve on. Based on the data we’ve gathered, the things we need to improve on was the internet connection because we are aware that internet is one of the most important factors on streaming, then, the frame drop of our stream will surely be needed to improve on because in order for the viewers to enjoy our stream, we need to give them a good output for our stream to be understandable. We’ll admit that we really struggled fixing the device and we’re planning to test new softwares to give our audience a better stream to watch. Lastly, the viewers also wanted us to do a face cam so they can see us and how we react whenever we play. We admit that watching streams are also enjoyable when you see the hosts on their cams playing the game you wanted and laughing at their reactions.</p>
        <p> These positive criticisms will make us a better streamer next time and we will surely take note of these comments and proceed with what we’ve already started and improve on what we missed to focus on next time.</p>

      <h2>IV. Level of engagement and how it affected the overall stream</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Our stream was aired on Facebook since our viewers are more comfortable watching the stream on Facebook rather than other streaming platforms. We can say that we were satisfied on how the viewers were engaging with us throughout the stream, they weren’t shy to let us know that they’re watching our stream, and we actually appreciate those people who watched us because whenever we will relive, those viewers would come back to our page and share our stream. It is like they’re still waiting for us to come back whenever we’re having a problem with the software. It affects our stream in a very positive way because those viewers will start talking to each other whenever they see our screen buffering and entertain themselves by talking to other viewers or by talking to the hosts on the comment section. We wanted to teach our viewers that it’s not  wrong to find new friends and we’re welcoming everyone who wants to be friends with us. We were moved because they showed how much they support us by staying with us from the start of the stream until the last seconds of our stream. </p>

      <h2>V. High or Low Viewership</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Our replay was the only option to know how many viewers we had during the entire stream. Our target audience was just 20 and were surprised to know that we actually had 200+ viewers that time. We considered those 200+ views as a high viewership because we weren’t really expecting a lot of audience to watch our stream. One factor that helped us reach that number of views was ourselves. We made sure that the information about our stream will reach from Grade 7 until Grade 12. Our friends were mostly our viewers and we’re really thankful for those people. Second is social media. We posted posters and even a short clip on how the hosts play the game. Call of Duty: Mobile is one of the trending games up to this day so I think what made them watch our stream was also the game we considered playing. </p>
        <p>Overall, we’re satisfied with the number of our participants since we’re just first time streamers and we really don’t expect that our views would go up to thousands. We’d love to keep going with those 200+ viewers and if time would allow us to be known, we will gladly accept more than what we expect based on the number of participants we had.</p>

          <h3>Characteristics of a Good Streamer</h3>
        </header>
        <p>1.) The Behaviour of the Streamer - This is the first and largest topic since I believe it is the most crucial in determining whether or not I will remain with a stream. I put streamer ahead of material since a consistent streamer is far more dependable than relying on specific stream content. Streamers come to mind as coworkers or classmates. Would I feel comfortable interacting with you if we were in the same area and had to do so frequently? When determining this, I take into account a few criteria.</p>
        <p>2.) Consistency - This is a large one that covers a lot of ground when it comes to streaming. When it comes to consistency, I examine the frequency of streaming, the flow of stream content, as well as mood and conduct. It's tough to keep interested in a stream when the start times are unpredictable, the streamer regularly starts content and walks on before finishing it, or the streamer appears to be a new person each time. I've found that having a game or a specific piece of content act as the backbone for someone's broadcast is the most effective way to maintain consistency. It's conceivable to bounce back and forth between diversity and consistency from there, especially if fresh strides are made.</p>
        <p>3.) Layout and Balance of the Stream - The aesthetics and sound quality of someone's stream are crucial, perhaps even more so for some than for others. When it comes to widescreen 16:9 games, I prefer full-screen games with no extra fluff. If the streamer has a webcam, there's almost always a good small place to tuck it into, and it just makes viewing more comfortable when there aren't any noisy boundaries distracting from the game. Frames and layouts don't deter me from watching a video unless they divert my attention away from the actual content.</p>
